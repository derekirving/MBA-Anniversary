_What led you to choose to do an MBA and why Strathclyde?_

The only university that is Top 20 in the world ranking (i think QS ranking at the time of applying to Strathclyde) for business school that offers January intake in the UK.

_What are your thoughts/memories of the programme? Any personal highlights?_

Summer in Toulouse.

_How has the MBA impacted on you since graduation (career or personal benefits)?_

Creating SMART goals, apparently it is compulsory to have it and renew it every year in NHS. Soft skills, speaking and dealing with people of various backgrounds, cultural awareness.

_What was the best thing about Strathclyde University?_

Unwavering support from MBA Admin team. Thank you Susan, Camilla, Jane, and the others ❤️
