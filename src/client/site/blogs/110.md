With a PhD in Chemistry and six years of experience in core sciences and research, I have spent much of my career immersed in the intricacies of organic chemistry within the life sciences and molecular diagnostics sectors. Although deeply rewarding, my work in scientific research led me to a crossroads where I recognised the importance of complementing my technical expertise with a strategic understanding of business. I wanted to bridge the gap between scientific innovation and impactful solutions by learning how to translate breakthroughs into real-world applications with societal value.

Taking the leap back into academia for an MBA after completing a PhD was a decision I approached with caution. The prospect of moving beyond the familiar realm of science was both exciting and daunting. However, driven by a desire to broaden my perspective and expand my leadership capacity, I ultimately decided that an MBA was the natural next step, not only for my career but as a journey of personal growth.

Strathclyde was the ideal place to pursue this vision. Known for its focus on leadership development and its collaborative ethos, the university offers an environment that nurtures growth both academically and personally. Receiving the Stephen Young Global Leader Scholarship was pivotal in alleviating financial constraints, allowing me to fully commit to this intensive programme. Beyond financial support, the scholarship felt like a powerful recognition of my previous work and efforts, affirming that good work never goes unrecognised. Strathclyde’s inclusive and inspiring culture made me confident in my decision to study in the UK, a destination renowned for academic excellence.

The MBA programme at Strathclyde exceeded my expectations, delivering an education that was both challenging and transformational. Each module contributed to a cohesive journey that pushed me to think critically and strategically. A highlight of the programme was the Capstone project, where I chose the consultancy route and developed a comprehensive marketing and sales strategy for an analytical science solutions company entering an emerging market. Applying my MBA learnings in a real-world context was immensely rewarding, and receiving the MBA Dean’s Commendation Prize for this project was a proud moment that affirmed the value of the skills I had gained. Through intensive coursework, I honed my analytical thinking, project management, and collaborative skills, each critical for leading projects and teams effectively in complex environments. This experience has fundamentally reshaped my approach to problem-solving, reinforcing the importance of strategic foresight and adaptability in driving sustainable solutions.

The programme also featured unique elements that set it apart, such as the Scenario Planning exercise, which offered profound insights into managing uncertainty in today’s VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) world, a rare and invaluable component in MBA curricula. Additionally, the Entrepreneurship module expanded my understanding of innovation and leadership in dynamic settings, reinforcing my confidence in tackling business challenges. Beyond academics, the Global Practitioner Programme and various initiatives like Strath Inspire and the Innovation Challenge enriched my learning experience. Engaging with industry leaders, guest speakers, and alumni broadened my perspective, offering real-world insights that helped me envision my own career path with clarity. These sessions, coupled with live consultancy projects, created a vibrant and engaging environment that complemented the core curriculum.

One of the most rewarding aspects of the MBA year was connecting with my classmates. The diversity of professional backgrounds and cultures created a dynamic environment where I continuously learned from others. Being surrounded by such inspiring future leaders was energising and gave me a sense of camaraderie that made the journey all the more memorable. The Strathclyde community, both teaching and non-teaching staff, offered incredible support, guiding me beyond academics and helping me grow as a leader.

Living in Glasgow has been equally rewarding. The city’s vibrant culture and warm community spirit truly make it a wonderful place to study and live. Glasgow’s motto, “People Make Glasgow,” resonates deeply with me; the warmth of its people made me feel at home. And when I needed a break, Scotland’s stunning landscapes provided a peaceful escape for reflection.

Reflecting on my MBA experience, I wholeheartedly recommend the Strathclyde MBA to anyone seeking a transformative journey that goes beyond academics. The programme equips you for the complexities of the business world while nurturing a purpose-driven, ethical approach to leadership. Strathclyde creates a supportive yet challenging environment, encouraging you to grow both professionally and personally. For those aiming to make a meaningful impact and refine their leadership skills, this MBA programme is the perfect foundation.

Taking this step into the unknown has proven immensely rewarding, and I encourage others to embrace calculated risks and challenge their usual paths. Venturing beyond our comfort zones can be daunting, but the rewards can be profound. My journey has been a testament to the value of stepping out, and I am inspired to see where this path will lead next. I am excited to carry forward the skills and perspectives I have gained at Strathclyde, ready to embrace new challenges and contribute to impactful innovations in the business world.
